# pyculator v2.6

A calculator with main functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and some additional ones such as: exponentiation, square root, percentage, modulo, fibonacci sequence, factorial function and a random number generator.

The program also outputs (apart from the result of the operation) some informations about the result number, such as: the number is even or odd, prime or composite, his divisors and displays a graph with matplotlib that shows the numbers input by the user and the result as a bar chart.

Finally, the pyculator displays a graphical user interface made with the tkinter library.
